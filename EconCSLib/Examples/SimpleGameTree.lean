# EconCSLib.Examples.SimpleGameTree

A sample 2-player zero-sum perfect-info game expressed in the
`GameTree` framework, used to smoke-test `value`, `Kuhn_exists_globalEndpointSPE`,
root-scoped Nash equilibrium, and the Zermelo-style zero-sum API.

The game (adapted from `ZerosumFiniteGame.lean`):

```
         [B]
        /    \
      [A]    (3)
     /   \
   (10) (-10)
```

* Player B (index 1) moves first, picks left (to A's subgame) or right (payoff 3).
* Player A (index 0) moves in the subgame, picks left (10) or right (-10).

Values represent payoff to Player 0 (A). In the zero-sum reading,
Player 1 (B) gets the negation.

Backward induction:
* A's subgame: A picks max{10, -10} = 10.
* B's full game: B picks min{10, 3} = 3.

So `value g 0 = 3`.
