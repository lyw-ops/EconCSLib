# Finite-EFG well-formedness regressions

These examples distinguish raw information catalogs from represented strategy
coordinates.

The presentations use one-state terminal base games. A ghost Boolean
information carrier fails the optional `AllDecisionInfoRepresented`
certificate but still satisfies the structural finite-EFG certificate and has
an inhabited pure-profile type. A separate regression shows that an irrelevant
terminal player label fails mover normalization but still creates no strategy
coordinate.
