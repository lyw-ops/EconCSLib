# Observed-chance analytic bridge and concrete-bundle boundary

This regression instantiates the complete-history analytic bridge on the
absent-minded three-rung game. The same player information state occurs at two
different nonterminal complete histories. An information-indexed behavioral
profile handles this correctly because its law is on the abstract `Unit`
information action and is realized separately at each history.

The second half records the exact boundary of the current analytic
`EventInformation.ActionPolicy`. After histories become analytic states, a
kernel into concrete state/action bundles cannot use one information value at
both player histories: legality would force the same probability measure to
have mass one on two different state fibers. The impossibility proof uses the
general `latestEventState_eq_of_informationAt_eq` theorem rather than relying
on terminal/nonterminal conflicts.

This example therefore verifies both sides of the design:

* the history-state bridge executes the behavioral profile and has the exact
  old finite stopped-history law;
* a future player-information bridge must add abstract actions with
  history-dependent realization instead of identifying concrete bundles.
