# Root Nash versus absolute-prefix continuation optimality

This finite one-player game has a root action that immediately earns the
maximal payoff and an off-path action that enters a second decision node.
The baseline profile chooses the maximal root action, but chooses the bad
action at the second node. A certified replacement strategy chooses the good
action at both nodes.

The regression proves:

* the baseline is Nash at the empty initial history, against every admitted
  measurable unilateral deviation;
* at the canonical absolute-prefix continuation from the off-path second
  history, the certified replacement raises expected payoff from zero to one;
* consequently the baseline is not measurable-kernel subgame perfect.

Every carrier is finite, every transition is deterministic, and every
relevant path terminates after one future step. The strict gap is therefore a
game-theoretic refinement gap, not a measurability, conditioning, or
nontermination artifact.
