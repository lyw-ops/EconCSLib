# Strict two-player regression for measurable profile assembly

This finite perfect-information game has two genuinely reachable decision
histories: player `false` moves at the root and player `true` moves after the
unique first action. Both concrete action fibers are singletons.

The common information carrier is the uncountable product of complete
histories with a real auxiliary coordinate; represented information uses
coordinate zero. The abstract action carrier is the unit interval. The
baseline profile uses a Dirac law for both players, while a replacement
strategy for player `true` uses unit-interval volume. The measurable profile
assembler constructs the deviation by branching on the tagged player
singleton.

The regression proves that:

* both player-controlled histories are inhabited;
* the replacement law is genuinely non-atomic and has no PMF representation;
* player `false`'s tagged kernel is unchanged;
* player `true`'s tagged kernel is changed;
* the assembled profiles satisfy the generic unilateral-deviation relation;
* splitting and reassembling an existing profile preserves its compiled event
  policy exactly.

The concrete realization deliberately forgets the abstract draw because each
legal fiber is a singleton. Thus this file tests player-indexed measurable
assembly rather than repeating the earlier non-atomic concrete-law boundary.
