# Pathwise versus profile-based winning

This regression proves that pathwise robust winning and winning against every
pure opponent profile differ in imperfect-information presentations.

Player `1` moves twice at the same information state. Every pure strategy for
player `1` must choose the same Boolean action on both visits. A merely legal
path may choose `false` and then `true`, however. Player `0` wins exactly on
paths compatible with some pure strategy of player `1`; consequently player
`0` wins against every pure profile but not against every locally compatible
path.
