# Recall-hierarchy regressions

Two small games separate the external recall predicates.

* `ForgetOthers` has classic perfect recall: neither player has made a prior
  decision at their current decision information. Player `0` nevertheless
  forgets a transient private signal revealing player `1`'s earlier action,
  so signal recall fails.
* `ForgetOwn` retains only the decision stage. At the second decision it
  forgets which Boolean action it chose at the first decision. Classic
  perfect recall fails although the information states are not repeated, so
  this is distinct from absent-mindedness.
* Payoff-free variants make the public/private boundaries explicit:
  classic or private-signal recall need not imply public recall, while public
  recall need imply neither private-signal nor classic recall.

The absent-minded regression itself remains in `AbsentMinded.lean`.
