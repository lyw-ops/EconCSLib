# A two-step imperfect-information game with no pure winner

This finite logical game uses the payoff-free `ControlledObservedGame`.
Player `0` chooses a hidden Boolean and player `1`, who observes no private or
public signal about that choice, guesses a Boolean. Player `0` wins on a
mismatch and player `1` wins on a match.

Every pure strategy of player `0` is defeated by the matching reply, while
every pure strategy of player `1` is defeated by the opposite hidden bit.
Thus the winning condition is total and exclusive, but neither player has a
pure pathwise winning strategy. This is the intended negative boundary:
totality is not determinacy, and finite length alone does not justify a
perfect-information determinacy theorem.
