# EconCSLib.Examples.ExtensiveGame.AbsentMinded

Regression for the no-absent-mindedness boundary documented in
`docs/design/efg-general-foundations-2-strategy.md`.

`ObservedGame.HasNoAbsentMindedness` is the hypothesis that a player never
revisits one of their decision information states along a single complete
history.  It is exactly the freshness premise consumed by
`ExtensiveGame.ObservedGame.FutureDecisionKeysAvailable.afterPlayer`: after a
player step erases the current decision key from the available set, no-absent-
mindedness is what guarantees the erased key cannot recur on any continuation.

This module builds a minimal finite `ObservedGame` that **is** absent-minded and
shows the failure explicitly.

## The game

Three collinear world states `s0 → s1 → s2`.  Player `0` moves at both `s0` and
`s1`, and every player observation and decision information state is trivial
(a single element).  Thus player `0` faces the *same* decision information state
at `s0` and again at `s1`, on one history.

## Main results

* `Examples.AbsentMinded.infoState_recurs` — the single player-`0` information
  state recurs along the history `s0 → s1`.
* `firstDecision_isLawfulSubgameRoot` and
  `secondDecision_not_isLawfulSubgameRoot` — the whole game remains a lawful
  subgame by convention, while the later proper root is rejected because its
  information set crosses the continuation boundary.
* `Examples.AbsentMinded.not_hasNoAbsentMindedness` and
  `not_noAbsentMindedness` — `HasNoAbsentMindedness`/`NoAbsentMindedness` fail.
* `not_signalPerfectRecall` — signal recall fails as a consequence, without
  conflating it with classic perfect recall.
* `Examples.AbsentMinded.futureDecisionKeysAvailable_firstDecision` — the
  non-freshness premises are genuinely satisfied before the first move.
* `Examples.AbsentMinded.afterPlayerConclusionFails` — the conclusion that
  `afterPlayer` would produce is *false* here: erasing the current decision key
  drops a key that is still required later.  This is precisely why the
  `NoAbsentMindedness` premise of `afterPlayer` is indispensable and
  unavailable for this game.
* `Examples.AbsentMinded.afterPlayer_premise_necessity` — all the relevant
  premises and the failed erased-key conclusion are packaged into one
  regression theorem; it demonstrates unavailability of the
  no-absent-mindedness premise, not falsity of `afterPlayer`.

Together with the failure after erasure below, this exposes

generalization that key erasure preserves future availability in every
observed game. -/

/-- **N-3.** No-absent-mindedness fails for player `0`: replaying the single
action from `s0` returns to the identical information state at `s1`.

This is the local missing hypothesis of `afterPlayer`; it prevents the false
generalization that every observed game satisfies

/-- Global no-absent-mindedness also fails.

This records that the global `NoAbsentMindedness` premise needed by
`FutureDecisionKeysAvailable.afterPlayer` is unavailable and prevents silently
generalizing the theorem after deleting that premise. -/

/-- The freshness premise of `FutureDecisionKeysAvailable.afterPlayer` is
unavailable here.  Starting from the current player decision at `s0` with only
its own key available, a player step would (by `afterPlayer`) claim the erased
set `{currentKey}.erase currentKey` still covers every future decision.  But the
identical key `currentKey` is required again at `s1`, so that claim is false.
Only `NoAbsentMindedness` — which this game lacks — rules this out. -/

/-- **N-3, premise necessity.** Every hypothesis of
`FutureDecisionKeysAvailable.afterPlayer` other than no-absent-mindedness holds
at `firstDecision`, the decidable-key instance is available, and yet the
conclusion `afterPlayer` would produce is false. Removing the
no-absent-mindedness premise therefore invalidates that generalization.

This says nothing against `afterPlayer` itself, whose no-absent-mindedness
hypothesis this game simply fails to satisfy. -/
