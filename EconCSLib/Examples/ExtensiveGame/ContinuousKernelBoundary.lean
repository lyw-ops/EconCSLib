# A genuinely continuous stochastic-arena boundary

This regression prevents `MeasurableKernelArena` from becoming a cosmetic
wrapper around the existing discrete `PMF` layer.

The example has unit-interval states, one action at every state, and the
non-atomic uniform volume law as its successor distribution.  The reverse
theorem proves that no `PMF` on the same state space has this measure, because
every `PMF` is concentrated on a countable support while unit-interval volume
assigns every countable set measure zero.

Its unique-action measurable policy also produces the same uniform law through
the terminal-aware analytic step kernel.  A second reverse theorem therefore
checks the execution layer, rather than only the raw transition layer.
