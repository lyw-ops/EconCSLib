# EconCSLib.Examples.CandidateChoice

A three-player candidate-choice game in the `GameTree` framework.

The game has three players, Eric, Larry, and Sergey. They sequentially vote for
one of three candidates: Lee, Rebecca, or John. If at least two players vote for
the same candidate, that candidate is accepted; if all three votes are distinct,
the outcome is rejected.

The file gives a compact finite perfect-information example and verifies that
the general `GameTree` equilibrium theorems apply to it.

/-! ### Players, candidates, and outcomes -/

/-- The three voters in the candidate-choice game. -/
inductive Player
  | Eric
  | Larry
  | Sergey
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- The candidates that can be chosen by each voter. -/
inductive Candidate
  | Lee
  | Rebecca
  | John
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- The final result of the voting process. -/
inductive Outcome
  | Accepted (c : Candidate)
  | Rejected

/-! ### Payoffs -/

/-- Player utilities over final outcomes.

The preferences are intentionally asymmetric:

* Eric prefers Lee, then Rebecca, then John.
* Larry prefers Rebecca, then John, then Lee.
* Sergey prefers John, then Lee, then Rebecca.
* All players rank rejection lowest.

/-! ### Voting rule -/

/-- Majority rule for the three sequential votes.

If two or more votes agree, the agreed candidate is accepted. If all three votes
are different, the outcome is rejected. -/

  | Rebecca, _, Rebecca => Accepted Rebecca
  | _, Rebecca, Rebecca => Accepted Rebecca
  | John, John, _ => Accepted John
  | John, _, John => Accepted John
  | _, John, John => Accepted John
  | _, _, _ => Rejected
