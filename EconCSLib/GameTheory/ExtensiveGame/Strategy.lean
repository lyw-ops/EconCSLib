# EconCSLib.GameTheory.ExtensiveGame.Strategy

Strategies for extensive-form games built on the Arena framework.

## Main definitions

* `Strategy G i` — a strategy for player `i`: choose an action at each state they control
* `StrategyProfile G` — strategies for all players
* `completeProfile` — fill in a strategy profile with an action-selection function
