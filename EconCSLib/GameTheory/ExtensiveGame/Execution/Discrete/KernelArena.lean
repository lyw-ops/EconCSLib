# Discrete probability-kernel arenas

Executable discrete stochastic transition systems and coupling-based
simulations.

This module is the implementation leaf for finite discrete execution.
`KernelArena` is the discrete stochastic analogue of `Arena`: an action
selects a normalized `PMF` of successor states rather than one deterministic
successor.
The simulation relation uses an explicit coupling of source and target
successor laws. Consequently it preserves probability mass, not merely the
existence of support paths.

This layer is representation-neutral. In particular, a FOSG macro step can
use a joint action here, while a serialized extensive-form implementation may
use a different state space and action presentation.

For non-atomic successor laws and genuine Mathlib Markov kernels, use
`MeasurableKernelArena`. `KernelArena.toMeasurable` embeds this discrete layer
there exactly.

## Main definitions

* `KernelArena` — dependent actions and normalized stochastic transitions.
* `KernelArena.Hom` — a functional transition-kernel morphism.
* `KernelArena.Simulation` — action matching by relational PMF couplings.

## Main result

* `KernelArena.Hom.toSimulation` — strict kernel morphisms induce stochastic
  simulations.
