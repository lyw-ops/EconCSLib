# EconCSLib.GameTheory.ExtensiveGame.Execution.Discrete.KernelTrajectory

Finite-horizon stochastic execution and exact trajectory transfer for
`KernelArena`.

A randomized Markov policy chooses a normalized action distribution only when
the current action type is nonempty.  Execution stops at terminal states, so
the interface remains inhabited for arenas which genuinely have leaves.
`KernelArena.Simulation.PolicyMatch` strengthens a one-sided simulation with
terminal agreement and a coupling of the two policies' action laws.  Positive
mass may be paired only between actions whose successor kernels themselves
admit a state-relation coupling.

The resulting transfer theorem is stronger than support-level reachability:
it constructs a joint PMF of complete finite traces, has the two trace laws as
its exact marginals, and is supported on pointwise-related traces.

## Main definitions

* `KernelArena.Policy` — randomized Markov policies.
* `KernelArena.stepLaw` — the one-step successor-state distribution.
* `KernelArena.stateLawFrom` — the state distribution after a finite horizon.
* `KernelArena.traceLawFrom` — the distribution of complete finite traces.
* `KernelArena.Simulation.PolicyMatch` — coupling-compatible policies.

## Main results

* `KernelArena.Simulation.PolicyMatch.stepCoupling` — exact one-step transfer.
* `KernelArena.Simulation.PolicyMatch.stateLawCoupling` — exact
  finite-horizon endpoint transfer.
* `KernelArena.Simulation.PolicyMatch.traceLawCoupling` — exact
  finite-horizon trajectory transfer.
* `KernelArena.Simulation.PolicyMatch.traceObservableLaw_eq` — exact equality
  of any related trace-observable laws.
