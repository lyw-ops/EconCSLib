# EconCSLib.GameTheory.ExtensiveGame.GameTreeSPE

Structural endpoint policies, outcomes, and backward induction on
`GameTree N U`.

The historical `Strategy` is one global child selector indexed by a node's
structural value `(mover, head, tail)`.  It is not bound to a root and cannot
distinguish two equal subtree values reached at different history
occurrences.  Consequently this module calls its predicate
`IsGlobalEndpointSubgamePerfect`: it is a stronger global structural
endpoint-policy theorem, not the canonical strategy space of a root-bound
perfect-information EFG.

The canonical occurrence-sensitive theorem is
`GameTree.Kuhn_exists_occurrencePureSPE` in
`Compiler.GameTreeOccurrenceObserved`.

## Minimal assumptions

Only `[TotalPreorder U]` — preorder + totality, no antisymmetry,
no decidability. See `ExtensiveGame/BackwardInduction.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `GameTree.Strategy` — a global structural endpoint policy: a
  subtype-bundled child-selector at every possible `(mover, head, tail)`.
* `GameTree.outcome` — the terminal payoff reached when following a strategy.
* `GameTree.optStrategy` — the canonical backward-induction strategy (picks
  a child whose value attains the backward-induction max for the node's mover).
* `GameTree.IVariant` — two strategies differ only at nodes whose mover is `i`.
* `GameTree.IsGlobalEndpointSubgamePerfect` — no structural endpoint-policy
  deviation improves at any tree value.

## Main results

* `outcome_optStrategy_eq_value` — outcome of `optStrategy` is the BI value.
* `optStrategy_isGlobalEndpointSubgamePerfect` — the backward-induction
  endpoint policy is globally optimal against structural endpoint deviations.
* `Kuhn_exists_globalEndpointSPE` — existence form for that historical layer.

## A note on the name "Kuhn"

The historical name refers to the backward-induction route underlying finite
SPE existence. The theorem exported by this module alone is the structural
endpoint-policy result; its canonical standard-SPE realization is proved by
the occurrence compiler. This is distinct from the *other* result also called
Kuhn's theorem—the equivalence of mixed and behavioral strategies under
perfect recall—whose infrastructure lives in the observed-game layer.

/-! ### Strategies -/

/-- A global structural endpoint policy: at every possible node context
    `(mover, head, tail)`, specify one child (bundled with its membership proof).

    Note: a single `Strategy` covers all players. Player-`i` "strategies"
    are conceptualized as the restriction to nodes where `mover = i`.
    Equal subtree values at distinct history occurrences are intentionally
    identified. -/
def Strategy (N U : Type*) : Type _ :=
  (m : N) → (h : GameTree N U) → (t : List (GameTree N U)) →
    { c : GameTree N U // c ∈ h :: t }

/-- The outcome (terminal payoff vector) of playing strategy `σ` starting
    from game tree `g`. Walks down the tree, using `σ` to pick a child at
    each `Node`, until a `Leaf` is reached. -/

/-! ### Backward-induction strategy -/

/-- The canonical backward-induction strategy: at each node, pick a child
    whose backward-induction value equals the node's value (i.e., a child
    attaining the argmax for the mover).

    Noncomputable — uses classical choice via `value_Node_eq_some_child_value`. -/
noncomputable def optStrategy [DecidableLE U] : Strategy N U := fun m h t =>
  ⟨(value_Node_eq_some_child_value m h t).choose,
   (value_Node_eq_some_child_value m h t).choose_spec.1⟩

/-- At a node, the `optStrategy` picks a child whose value equals the node's value. -/

  ((value_Node_eq_some_child_value m h t).choose_spec.2).symm

/-! ### Strategy deviation -/

/-- Two strategies are `i`-variants if they agree on all nodes NOT owned by `i`.
    I.e., `σ'` is obtained from `σ` by changing only player `i`'s choices. -/
def IVariant (i : N) (σ σ' : Strategy N U) : Prop :=
  ∀ (m : N) (h : GameTree N U) (t : List (GameTree N U)),

theorem IVariant.refl (i : N) (σ : Strategy N U) : IVariant i σ σ :=
  fun _ _ _ _ => rfl

/-! ### Subgame-perfect equilibrium -/

/-- Historical global endpoint-policy optimality: at every tree value, no
player can improve by switching to an `i`-variant global endpoint policy.

This is not the root-bound occurrence-sensitive standard EFG predicate; use
`ObservedGame.IsPureStandardSubgamePerfect` through
`GameTree.toOccurrenceObservedGame` for that semantics. -/

/-! ### Kuhn's theorem (main result) -/

/-- **Key lemma**: the outcome of the backward-induction strategy equals
    the backward-induction value vector at every game tree.

    This is the bridge between `value` (defined via argmax) and `outcome`
    (defined via tree traversal). -/

/-- **Optimality of `optStrategy`**: for every subtree `g`, every player `i`,
    and every `i`-variant deviation `σ'`, the deviating outcome is no better
than `optStrategy`'s outcome at coordinate `i`. This is the global structural
endpoint-policy property spelled out before bundling into existence form. -/
