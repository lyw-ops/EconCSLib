# EconCSLib.GameTheory.ExtensiveGame.GameTree

Finite extensive-form games of **perfect information, without chance**,
encoded as a generic inductive type.

## Design

```
inductive GameTree (N U : Type*)
  | Leaf (payoff : N → U)
  | Node (mover : N) (head : GameTree N U) (tail : List (GameTree N U))
```

* **N** — the player set (need not be finite or decidable).
* **U** — the payoff type (will acquire `[TotalPreorder U]` at theorem sites,
  not in the type definition — Bourbaki discipline).
* **Finite** via inductive structure.
* **Non-empty children at each `Node`** via the `head : GameTree` + `tail : List ...`
  split — `head` provides a witness, `tail` the rest.
* **No `Nature` / chance constructor**: normalized finite chance is provided
  separately by `StochasticGameTree`.

## Main definitions

* `GameTree` — the inductive type itself
* `GameTree.size` — structural size (well-founded recursion helper)
* `GameTree.children` — the full child list `head :: tail` at a `Node`
* `GameTree.mapChildren` — apply a function to every child of a `Node`

/-- A finite extensive-form game of perfect information, without chance.

    * `Leaf payoff` — a terminal state with a payoff vector `N → U`.
    * `Node mover head tail` — a decision node owned by `mover`,
      with non-empty children `head :: tail`.

    Finiteness is built into the inductive type; non-emptiness of
    children is built into the `Node` constructor via `head + tail`. -/

/-! ### Subtree relation

`Subtree s g` means the tree `s` occurs somewhere inside `g` (reflexively, or
as the head / a tail element, recursively). It is useful for stating
structural endpoint-policy properties over subtree values. Distinct equal
occurrences remain identified; standard occurrence-sensitive subgames use the
history compiler instead. -/

/-- `Subtree s g` — `s` occurs as a subtree of `g`. -/
inductive Subtree : GameTree N U → GameTree N U → Prop
  | refl (g : GameTree N U) : Subtree g g
  | inHead (s : GameTree N U) (m : N) (h : GameTree N U) (t : List (GameTree N U))

      {c : GameTree N U} (hmem : c ∈ t) (hs : Subtree s c) :
      Subtree s (Node m h t)

/-! ### Strong induction on size

A size-based strong induction principle: to prove `motive g`, assume
`motive c` for every child `c ∈ h :: t` of a `Node`. Stronger than the
default inductive recursor (which only gives IH on the head), and
precisely what backward-induction proofs need. -/

/-- **Strong induction**: to prove `motive g`, it suffices to handle `Leaf`
    and, for each `Node`, to prove the motive given the motive for every
    child (head or tail). -/
theorem strong_induction {motive : GameTree N U → Prop}
    (base : ∀ p, motive (Leaf p))
    (step : ∀ (m : N) (h : GameTree N U) (t : List (GameTree N U)),
              (∀ c ∈ h :: t, motive c) → motive (Node m h t))
    (g : GameTree N U) : motive g := by
  -- Well-founded recursion on `size`.
  suffices h : ∀ (n : ℕ) (g : GameTree N U), g.size ≤ n → motive g from
    h g.size g (Nat.le_refl _)
  intro n
  induction n with
  | zero =>
      intro g hg
      exact absurd hg (Nat.not_le_of_lt (size_pos g))
  | succ k ih =>
      intro g hg
      cases g with
      | Leaf p => exact base p
      | Node m h t =>
          apply step m h t
          intro c hmem
          apply ih c
          rcases List.mem_cons.mp hmem with rfl | hmem'
          · have := size_head_lt m c t
            omega
          · have := size_mem_tail_lt m h t hmem'
