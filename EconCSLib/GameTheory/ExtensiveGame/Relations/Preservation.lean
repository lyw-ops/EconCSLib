# Formal preservation-certificate vocabulary

This module is the Lean counterpart of `docs/design/efg-preservation-matrix.md`.
It gives one stable namespace for the relation strengths used by EFG
compilers and semantic bridges. Most entries are aliases of the authoritative
relation structures; the aliases do not add stronger preservation claims.

Strict compiler packages carry a payoff-free observed-game isomorphism and an
external root-correspondence proof. Weak compiler packages instead carry a
progressing weak simulation, which is the appropriate contract for
stuttering, macro/micro serialization, and endpoint-forgetting.

`PathLawCoupling` is deliberately law-level: it stores a joint measure, both
marginals, and almost-sure support on a relation. It does not imply a strict
state or strategy isomorphism.
