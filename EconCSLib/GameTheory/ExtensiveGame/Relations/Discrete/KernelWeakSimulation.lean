# EconCSLib.GameTheory.ExtensiveGame.Relations.Discrete.KernelWeakSimulation

Probabilistic weak/stuttering simulation from a stochastic kernel Arena to a
deterministic serialized Arena.

One source macro action is matched by a positive amount of target execution
under a normalized history policy.  The source successor law and target
endpoint law must admit a relation-supported coupling.  A customizable
`PolicyAdmissible` predicate can require, for example, that target chance nodes
use the chance kernels specified by an `ObservedChanceGame`.

The support Arena exposes a realized stochastic transition as an action paired
with a positive-probability successor.  The main theorem proves that every
probabilistic weak simulation induces a progressing ordinary `Arena`
weak/stuttering simulation from this support Arena to the target history
unfolding.

## Main definitions

* `KernelArena.supportArena` — the Arena of positive-probability realized
  kernel transitions.
* `KernelArena.ProbabilisticWeakSimulation` — finite target execution plus
  exact successor-law coupling.
* `KernelArena.executionKernelArena` — packages finite serialized executions
  as macro transitions of a stochastic arena.

## Main results

* `ProbabilisticWeakSimulation.toKernelSimulation` — expose a weak serializer
  as an ordinary coupling-based kernel simulation at macro boundaries.
* `ProbabilisticWeakSimulation.toSupportWeakSimulation` — forget probabilities
  and obtain an ordinary weak simulation.
* `toSupportWeakSimulation_progressing` — every matched macro step uses at
  least one target transition.
