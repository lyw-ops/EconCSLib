# Winning conditions on complete extensive-game plays

This module treats a winning condition as objective data: one set of complete
legal plays for each player. It does not build finiteness, determinacy,
measurability, or equilibrium assumptions into that data.

The primary definitions accept an arbitrary current absolute history. Root
specializations are abbreviations. Terminal win/lose rules embed without
assigning a winner to a nonterminating play, while path outcomes embed by
ordinary inverse image.

For observed games, compatibility with one player's pure strategy constrains
only that player's decision coordinates. The API distinguishes pathwise
robustness from winning against information-consistent opponent profiles.
Pure and quasistrategy play-compatibility predicates are defined in the
payoff-free `ControlledInfrastructure` leaves; this module adds their
winning-condition interpretations.

## Main definitions

* `Arena.WinningConditionFrom` and `Arena.WinningCondition`.
* `WinningConditionFrom.IsExclusive` and `.IsTotal`.
* `WinningConditionFrom.ofTerminal` and `.ofPathOutcome`.
* `WinningConditionFrom.DecidesAt` and `.PrefixDecision`.
* `ControlledObservedGame.IsCompatibleWithPlayerStrategyFrom`.
* `ControlledObservedGame.HasPathwiseWinningStrategy`.
* `ControlledObservedGame.HasWinningQuasiStrategy`.

The payoff-aware `ObservedGame` surface is isolated in `Winning.BasicCompat`.
