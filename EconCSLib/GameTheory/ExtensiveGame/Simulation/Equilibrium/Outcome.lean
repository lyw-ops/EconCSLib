# Equilibrium.Outcome — path utility for kernel-valued observed games

The measurable observed-game executor produces a probability measure on
complete infinite state paths. This module adds the economic interpretation
that must remain separate from execution:

* `MeasurableHistoryModel.PathUtility` is an explicitly measurable
  player-indexed real functional on complete state paths;
* `PathUtility.IntegrableAt` records integrability for one profile and initial
  history;
* `expectedUtility` requires that certificate rather than silently using the
  Bochner integral's default value for a non-integrable function;
* `BoundedPathUtility` supplies integrability uniformly for every profile;
* `ProfileAssembly.IsNashAmongIntegrableDeviations` and
  `BoundedPathUtility.IsNashAt` quantify over the constructive player
  deviations from the profile-assembly layer;
* terminal-payoff extensions and `TerminatesBy` provide an explicit safe
  finite-horizon bridge to the base game's terminal payoff;
* `TerminatesAlmostSurely`, `eventualUtility`, and dominated convergence
  support unbounded random termination without inventing an endpoint on
  nonterminating paths.

The generic path-utility layer never reads a terminal payoff implicitly. The
terminal bridges below require a measurable extension plus either an explicit
finite-horizon certificate or almost-sure eventual terminal absorption.

/-- In a countable discrete history presentation, almost-sure reachability
upgrades to almost-sure terminal absorption.

The proof uses the executor's terminal-aware step kernel. Event-carrier
countability and measurable singletons make the pathwise equality events
measurable; state countability is derived from the event carrier, while state
singletons are already supplied by `MeasurableHistoryModel`. These are not
assumptions about the economic game's horizon. -/
