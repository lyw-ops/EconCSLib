# Kernel.Arena — measurable probability-kernel arenas

`KernelArena` is the executable discrete stochastic arena: its transitions are
`PMF`s.  `MeasurableKernelArena` is the analytic extension boundary.  It stores
a genuine Mathlib Markov kernel from the dependent state/action bundle to the
state space, so successor laws may be non-atomic.

The measurable space on the total action bundle

```lean
Σ state, Action state
```

is explicit data.  This avoids pretending that an arbitrary dependent family
of measurable action spaces automatically gives the intended measurable
structure on legal state/action pairs.

## Main definitions

* `MeasurableKernelArena` — dependent actions and a normalized measurable
  transition kernel.
* `MeasurableKernelArena.Hom` — measurable strict transition morphisms.
* `KernelArena.toMeasurable` — the exact discrete-to-analytic embedding.
* `KernelArena.Hom.toMeasurable` — reuse of strict discrete morphisms.

This module does not yet define measure-valued policies or trajectory laws.
Those require an explicit measurable legality condition for policy kernels and
belong in a subsequent execution layer.
