# Presentation.Kernel.ProfileAssembly — measurable player-profile assembly

`KernelBehavioralProfile` is an admissible complete joint policy. This module
adds a constructive layer: one jointly measurable player kernel on explicitly
tagged player inputs and a fixed abstract chance lift are combined into that
joint policy.

An `InformationRoles` certificate exposes measurable terminal and player
regions of the common information carrier and a measurable player tag.
`ProfileAssembly` additionally supplies an abstract chance kernel whose
history-dependent realization is the presentation's fixed concrete chance
law.

`PlayerKernelProfile` stores all player laws in one measurable kernel on a
tagged input carrier. This joint measurability is intentional: an arbitrary
family indexed by an uncountable player type need not glue to a kernel.
`PlayerStrategy` stores one replacement player's law.
Piecewise kernel composition implements `deviate`, while the role certificate
implements terminal/player/chance assembly.

No measurable ownership test, fallback player, or measurable selection is
inferred. Every set and map used by the branching construction is explicit
certificate data.
