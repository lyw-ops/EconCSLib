# Presentation.Chance.MeasurableHistory — measurable complete-history models

The representation-neutral `ObservedGame` interface deliberately puts no
measurable spaces on histories or dependent legal actions.  This module
records exactly the measurable data needed to regard its complete-history
unfolding as a `MeasurableKernelArena`.

A `MeasurableHistoryModel` supplies measurable spaces on

```lean
HistoryFrom init
Σ history : HistoryFrom init, Action history.1
```

together with measurability of projection, deterministic history append, and
the terminal set.  Its transition kernel is required pointwise to be the
Dirac/`PMF.pure` history-append law.  Measurable singletons are recorded
because the joint event-policy compiler uses them to express legality.

The structure is an explicit certificate, not an automatic measurable-space
inference principle.  In particular, it can carry standard-Borel structures
on uncountable history and action spaces when the model author proves the
dependent append map measurable.

`MeasurableHistoryModel.discrete` recovers the established top-measurable
`KernelArena.toMeasurable` lift exactly.  It is useful for compatibility, but
on an uncountable carrier its top measurable space is not advertised as a
standard-Borel presentation.
