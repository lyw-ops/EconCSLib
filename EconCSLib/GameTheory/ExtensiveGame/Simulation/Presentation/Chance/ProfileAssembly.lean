# Presentation.Chance.ProfileAssembly — PMF player-profile assembly

This module is the exact compatibility seam between the established
`ObservedChanceGame.MeasurablePresentation` API and the general measurable
player-kernel assembler.

An explicit measurable `InformationRoles` certificate is still required:
measurable ownership cannot be recovered from the old local correctness
equations alone. Given that certificate and one reference behavioral profile,
`profileAssembly` reuses the old profile's fixed abstract chance lift.

Every old PMF behavioral profile can then be split into tagged player kernels
and reassembled. The resulting compiled event policy is exactly the old
compiled policy.
