# EconCSLib.GameTheory.ExtensiveGame.Interface.Winning

Opt-in public facade for logical extensive games: complete-play winning
conditions, pathwise robust and profile-based pure winning strategies,
pathwise quasi winning strategies, two-player determinacy predicates, and
explicit finite/well-founded determinacy hypothesis packages.

The facade does not claim arbitrary winning-set determinacy. The payoff-free
finite perfect-information, no-chance, two-player zero-sum theorem is exposed
as `FiniteTwoPlayerHypotheses.isTwoPlayerDetermined`. The well-founded-prefix
and Gale--Stewart existence theorems remain explicit theorem tracks;
topological and almost-sure winning remain later opt-in layers. For arbitrary
player types,
`HasSomePathwiseWinningStrategy` is deliberately not named “determined.”
