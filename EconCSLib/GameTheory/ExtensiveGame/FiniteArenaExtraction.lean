# EconCSLib.GameTheory.ExtensiveGame.FiniteArenaExtraction

Interfaces for extracting finite no-chance Arena-style games into `GameTree`.

The general reverse bridge from `ExtensiveGame` to `GameTree` cannot be total:
the Arena API allows infinite state spaces, cycles, chance states, and histories
that merge.  This file records the assumptions needed for extraction and gives
small certified extraction constructors that can be extended case by case.

## Main definitions

* `ExtensiveGame.NoChance` — every nonterminal state has a strategic mover.
* `ExtensiveGame.TreeShapedFrom` — uniqueness of histories into a state.
* `ExtensiveGame.FiniteExtractable` — explicit assumption package for reverse
  extraction.
* `ExtensiveGame.ActionListComplete` — an explicit finite action enumeration at
  one state.
* `ExtensiveGame.ExtractsGameTree` — relational extraction from a state to a
  `GameTree`.
* `ExtensiveGame.extractTerminalGameTree` — certified extraction of a terminal
  state to a one-leaf `GameTree`.
* `ExtensiveGame.ExtractsGameTree.leaf_payoff` — extracted leaves preserve the
  Arena payoff vector.
* `ExtensiveGame.ExtractsGameTree.node_head_reachable` — the extracted head
  child is reached by one Arena transition.

variable {N U : Type*} (G : ExtensiveGame N U)

/-- A tree-shapedness condition: there is at most one typed action history from
    the root to each state.

This quantifies over `Arena.History`, whose inhabitants retain the chosen
actions.  Quantifying over `Arena.Reachable` proofs would be vacuous because
reachability is a proposition and hence proof-irrelevant. -/
def TreeShapedFrom (root : G.State) : Prop :=
  ∀ s : G.State, Subsingleton (G.toArena.History root s)

/-- Assumptions under which an Arena-style game can be extracted to a finite
    no-chance `GameTree`.  The actual recursive extraction is intentionally not
    bundled here; users provide a finite unfolding depth or well-founded child
    enumeration appropriate for their concrete game. -/

  state_finite : Nonempty (Fintype G.State)
  no_chance : G.NoChance
  tree_shaped : G.TreeShapedFrom G.init

/-- A nonempty action list `head :: tail` contains every available action at
    state `s`.  The list is an explicit finite enumeration supplied by the
    concrete game. -/

    Prop :=
  ∀ a : G.Action s, a ∈ head :: tail

/- Relational extraction of an Arena-style no-chance extensive game state to a
    finite `GameTree`.

The relation is intentionally assumption-explicit: each decision node supplies a
complete nonempty action enumeration, a player owner, and extracted child trees
for exactly that action list. -/
