# EconCSLib.GameTheory.ExtensiveGame.ImperfectInformation

A finite-state interface for imperfect-information extensive games.

This is intentionally a lightweight structural layer. It records vertices,
available actions, transitions, mover ownership, terminal payoffs,
information-set labels, an abstract action type for every information set, and
explicit equivalences to concrete legal actions. Mover and decision-node
well-formedness conditions remain predicates so theorem statements can assume
exactly the conditions they need.

Only the state carrier is structurally finite. The interface does not itself
assert acyclicity, termination, reachability of every state, or finiteness of
unused information/action carriers; results needing those properties must
state them separately.

## Main definitions

* `FiniteImperfectGame` — compact finite-state imperfect-information game data.
* `FiniteImperfectGame.subgameAt` — the same game rooted at a chosen state.
* `SameMoverOnInfo` — nodes in one information set have the same mover.
* `SameActionsOnInfo` — nodes in one information set have the same action type.
* `NoChanceOnDecisionInfo` — information sets are only used at player nodes.
* `PlayerInfoSet` — information sets witnessed for one player.
* `PureStrategy` — abstract choices indexed only by that player's information
  sets.
* `PureStrategy.actionAt` — induced action at a concrete state.

/-- Compact finite-state imperfect-information extensive game data.

`info s = none` means the state is not in a strategic information set, typically
because it is terminal or chance-controlled.  `info s = some k` places state `s`
in information set `k`.

The structure name is historical: only `State` is required to be finite.
Termination, acyclicity, and any additional finiteness assumptions are
deliberately theorem-local. -/
