# Analytic-kernel adapter to controlled complete-path semantics

This downstream adapter packages the actual state/history-path law generated
by `MeasurableKernelPresentation` in the same payoff-free
`CompletePathLawSemantics` used by discrete PMF execution.  Player strategy
carriers and their measurable profile assembly are supplied explicitly.

The analytic executor already proves normalization.  Canonical
`Arena.IsCompletePlayPathFrom` support is an explicit adapter premise because
the general measurable-kernel executor also supports stochastic state arenas
whose paths are not deterministic `Arena.next` histories.
