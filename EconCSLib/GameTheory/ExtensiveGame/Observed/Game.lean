# EconCSLib.GameTheory.ExtensiveGame.Observed.Game

A history-indexed observed extensive-game layer over `ExtensiveGame`.

The base game continues to own states, dependent actions, transitions, movers,
and payoffs.  This wrapper adds an observation for every player at every
history and a public observation at every history.  Player-controlled histories
also map to decision information states, which determine abstract action types.
An explicit equivalence identifies those abstract actions with the legal base
actions.

This indexing makes information-set consistency structural: a pure strategy
has type

```lean
(I : G.InfoState i) → G.InfoAction i I
```

and therefore cannot inspect the concrete history after receiving `I`.

This core module defines player-controlled no-chance execution. The
`Chance` and `Behavior` extension modules add normalized
chance kernels and behavioral strategies without changing the base history or
information-indexed pure-strategy interfaces.

## Main definitions

* `ExtensiveGame.ObservedGame` — observations and information-indexed actions
  over a base extensive game.
* `ObservedGame.ofControlledObservedGame` and `toControlledObservedGame` —
  attach an arbitrary state payoff to, or erase it from, the payoff-free
  controlled observed carrier.
* `ObservedGame.relabelPlayers` and `relabelPureProfileEquiv` — reindex the
  player carrier, payoff coordinates, and dependent pure profiles along an
  equivalence.
* `ObservedGame.historyInformation` — the legacy all-history information
  carrier with an explicit public projection.
* `ObservedGame.decisionHistoryInformation` — full-history private observation
  with decision-only information states.
* `ObservedGame.completeInformation` — the canonical root-free
  decision-history complete-information carrier of an ordinary
  `ExtensiveGame`.
* `ObservedGame.ContinuationRootPresentation.initialOnly` and
  `.allHistories` — explicit, orthogonal choices of presentation-designated
  continuation roots.
* `ObservedGame.PureStrategy` and `PureProfile` — game-bound contingent plans.
* `PureProfile.toHistoryPolicy` — terminal-aware execution of a no-chance
  profile.
* `ObservedGame.RootPresentation` — external history roots selected for one
  continuation analysis; lawfulness as standard subgames is separate.
* `ObservedGame.IsLawfulSubgameRoot`, `SubgameSystem`, and
  `CompleteSubgameSystem` — compatibility names projected definitionally from
  the canonical payoff-free `ControlledObservedGame` infrastructure.
* `ObservedGame.stoppedHistoryFrom`, `stoppedPayoffFrom`, `stoppedHistory`, and
  `stoppedPayoff` — continuation and root profile semantics.

`Observation` is defined for every player at every history, including histories
where that player does not move.  `observe_public` says that each player's
observation refines the public observation.  `InfoState` indexes only
player-decision information; `infoAt` and `actionEquiv` are therefore required
only when the history is controlled by the given player. -/
