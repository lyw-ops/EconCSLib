# Stochastic-game-tree compiler

This module compiles `StochasticGameTree` into the history-indexed
`ObservedChanceGame` interface.  The presentation is occurrence-sensitive:
private and public observations are complete typed histories, so equal subtree
values at different paths remain distinct decisions.

The compiler preserves the source tree's finite child-occurrence type and
chance `PMF` definitionally.  A source pure policy induces a Dirac behavioral
profile.  Bounded execution then has exactly the same endpoint-subtree law as
the source recursive execution, not merely a coupling or simulation.

Only terminal payoffs are semantic.  The total payoff field required by
`ExtensiveGame` is zero at player and chance nodes.
