# EconCSLib.GameTheory.ExtensiveGame.Compiler.GameTreeOccurrenceObserved

An occurrence-sensitive observed-EFG compiler for `GameTree`.

`GameTree.toObservedGame` deliberately reuses the historical
`GameTree.PlayerStrategy` interface: its observations and information states
depend only on the endpoint subtree or node context.  Equal subtree values
appearing at different occurrences are therefore identified.

This module provides a second, genuinely perfect-information representation.
Every private/public observation is the complete typed history occurrence, and
a decision information state is a complete history together with evidence
that the corresponding player moves there.  Consequently, equal information
states imply equal history occurrences, and the compiled EFG has perfect
information and perfect recall.

The occurrence-sensitive game refines the endpoint compiler rather than being
strictly isomorphic to it.  Explicit forgetting maps erase the occurrence and
retain the endpoint subtree/node context.  Conversely, every endpoint-indexed
pure strategy lifts canonically to an occurrence strategy, and the lifted
profile generates exactly the same concrete history policy and bounded
outcome.

## Main definitions

* `GameTree.OccurrenceInfo` — a player-controlled complete history occurrence.
* `GameTree.toOccurrenceObservedGame` — the occurrence-sensitive observed EFG.
* `GameTree.forgetOccurrenceObservation` and `forgetOccurrenceInfo` — the
  concrete information-forgetting maps.
* `GameTree.liftEndpointPureStrategy` and `liftEndpointPureProfile` — strategy
  lifting from the endpoint compiler to the finer occurrence compiler.
* `GameTree.endpointBehavioralInformationRefinement` — the same compiler
  relation with exact behavioral/chance semantics.

## Main results

* `toOccurrenceObservedGame_perfectInformation` and
  `toOccurrenceObservedGame_perfectRecall`.
* `forgetOccurrenceInfo_observe` and
  `forgetOccurrenceInfoActionEquiv_at`.
* `liftEndpointPureProfile_toHistoryPolicy`,
  `stoppedHistoryFrom_liftEndpointPureProfile`, and
  `stoppedPayoffFrom_liftEndpointPureProfile`.
* `occurrenceBackwardInductionProfile_isPureStandardSubgamePerfect` and
  `Kuhn_exists_occurrencePureSPE` — canonical root-bound standard SPE against
  all occurrence-dependent unilateral deviations.
* `behavioralStoppedPayoffLawFrom_liftEndpoint` and
  `isEndpointBehavioralNashOnDesignatedContinuationsAtFuel_of_occurrenceLift`.
