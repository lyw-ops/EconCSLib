# Payoff-free structural carriers for extensive games

This module contains only the representation-neutral dynamics used by the
minimal EFG core.

## Main definitions

* `Arena` — states, dependent legal actions, and transitions.
* `Arena.IsTerminal` — terminality as absence of legal actions.
* `ControlledGame` — an Arena with a root and player-control labels.
* `Arena.ofFin` — a small constructor for explicitly finite arenas.

No payoff, objective, probability law, finiteness assumption, decidability
assumption, or information structure is stored in these carriers. In
particular, `mover s = none` is only a non-player-control label. A chance law,
when desired, belongs to a separate stochastic semantics layer.

This state-space representation permits merging paths, cycles, and infinite
state or action types. History unfolding is provided separately.

/-- A game arena: the pure dynamics of an extensive-form game.

States, actions, and transitions are stored without players, payoffs, or
probability. A state is terminal iff `Action s` is empty. -/
structure Arena where
  /-- The state space. -/
  State : Type*
  /-- Available actions at each state. Empty means terminal. -/
  Action : State → Type*
  /-- Transition function from a state and one legal action. -/

end Arena

/-- A payoff-free controlled extensive-game skeleton.

`ControlledGame` adds only a distinguished initial state and a mover label to
the pure `Arena` dynamics. It deliberately stores no objective, payoff,
probability law, finiteness, decidability, or information data.

At a nonterminal state, `mover s = none` means only that the state is not
controlled by a strategic player. It does not itself supply a chance
distribution. The mover label at a terminal state is semantically ignored. -/
