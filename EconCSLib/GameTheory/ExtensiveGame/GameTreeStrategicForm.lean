# EconCSLib.GameTheory.ExtensiveGame.GameTreeStrategicForm

Structural endpoint-plan normal-form extraction for finite `GameTree` games.

The extracted normal-form game gives every player a complete contingent plan:
at each structural endpoint context `(mover, head, tail)`, choose one of the
available children. Equal subtree values at distinct history occurrences are
merged. During play, the node's mover selects which player's plan is used.

Thus this is not the canonical occurrence-sensitive strategic form of a
root-bound EFG. For that strategy space use `toOccurrenceObservedGame`; its
pure profiles are indexed by complete decision-history occurrences.

## Main definitions

* `GameTree.PlayerStrategy` — one player's contingent plan on a `GameTree`.
* `GameTree.profileStrategy` — combine a normal-form profile into a global tree
  strategy.
* `GameTree.toStrategicGame` — extracted pure normal-form game.

## Main results

* `toStrategicGame_nash_iff_isNashAt` — pure Nash in the extracted game is
  exactly root-scoped Nash in the original tree.
