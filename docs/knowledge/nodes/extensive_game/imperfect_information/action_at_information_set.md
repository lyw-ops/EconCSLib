# Action At An Information Set

For an information set $P^i_k$, successors of nodes in $P^i_k$ are grouped into
equivalence classes representing the same physical action. The action set available
to player $i$ at $P^i_k$ is denoted
$$
  A_i(P^i_k).
$$
A strategy at imperfect information must choose an action in $A_i(P^i_k)$, not a
node-specific successor.
