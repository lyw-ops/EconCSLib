# Extensive Game With Imperfect Information

An extensive game with imperfect information keeps the tree, player assignments,
and terminal payoffs of an extensive form, but also records what each player knows
when making a move. This is represented by information sets that group decision
nodes a player cannot distinguish.

The Lean `FiniteImperfectGame` presentation guarantees a finite state carrier
and coherent information-set actions. It deliberately leaves acyclicity,
termination, reachability, and any additional carrier finiteness as separate
assumptions.
