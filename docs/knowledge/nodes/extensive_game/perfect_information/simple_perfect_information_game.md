# Simple Perfect-Information Game

A two-player perfect-information game is simple if its terminal outcomes are
partitioned into winning sets $(R_1,R_2)$, where reaching a terminal node in $R_i$
means player $i$ wins and the other player loses.

A winning strategy for player $i$ is a strategy $\sigma_i$ such that, for every
opponent strategy $\sigma_{-i}$,
$$
  F(\sigma_i,\sigma_{-i})\in R_i.
$$
