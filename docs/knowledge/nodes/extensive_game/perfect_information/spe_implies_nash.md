# Subgame-Perfect Equilibrium Implies Nash Equilibrium

In a perfect-information game, every subgame-perfect equilibrium is a Nash
equilibrium of the whole game.

## Proof Sketch

The whole game is the subgame rooted at the origin. Since subgame perfection
requires the continuation profile to be Nash in every subgame, applying the
definition at the origin gives the Nash condition for the original game.
