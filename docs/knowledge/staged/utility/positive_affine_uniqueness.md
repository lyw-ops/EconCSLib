# Positive Affine Uniqueness Of Utility

If two expected-utility functions represent the same preference over lotteries,
then they differ by a positive affine transformation:
$$
  v(L)=a u(L)+b
  \quad\text{with}\quad a>0.
$$

Conversely, a positive affine transformation of a representing utility function
represents the same preference relation.

## Proof Sketch

The order-preserving direction is immediate from $a>0$. For uniqueness, compare
the two representations on degenerate lotteries and use linearity over lotteries
to extend the affine relation from outcomes to all lotteries.

The Lean library has the positive-affine relation and its order-preservation and
inverse lemmas. The full uniqueness theorem for linear utility functionals is
still an open theorem target in `EconCSLib/Utility/Lottery.lean`.
