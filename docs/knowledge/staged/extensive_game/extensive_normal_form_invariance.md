# Normal Form Invariance Of Extensive Representations

Two extensive forms can have the same normal form even when their trees and
information sets look different. MFoGT records that extensive forms with the same
normal form can be linked by chains of elementary transformations: interchange of
simultaneous moves, coalescing of consecutive moves, and addition of superfluous
moves.

## Proof Sketch

The statement is structural rather than an equilibrium theorem. Each elementary
transformation preserves the pure strategy sets up to canonical identification and
preserves the outcome induced by every strategy profile. Chains of these moves
therefore preserve the normal form.

## Lean Status

The existing `GameTree.toStrategicGame_nash_iff_isNashAt` theorem proves the
Nash correspondence for one fixed `GameTree` and its induced strategic game.
It does not formalize interchange, coalescing, superfluous-move elimination,
or the claimed characterization by chains of elementary transformations.
This broader proposition therefore remains staged.
