# Potential Maximizer Is Nash

In a finite exact potential game, every global maximizer of the potential is a
pure Nash equilibrium.

The proof is local: if a unilateral deviation from a potential maximizer were
profitable, exactness would make the same deviation increase the potential,
contradicting maximality.
