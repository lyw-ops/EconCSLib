# General EFG Foundations: Information, Strategies, and Solutions

This is the conceptual continuation of
[`efg-general-foundations.md`](efg-general-foundations.md). Section numbering
continues from that document. The Lean interface continues in
[`efg-general-foundations-3-lean-api.md`](efg-general-foundations-3-lean-api.md).

Status: target architecture. Existing Lean source remains authoritative until
each item is implemented and governance-registered.

## 7. Information and recall

The existing presentation already encodes the textbook common-action
requirement: `InfoAction i I` is transported by an equivalence to the concrete
legal action type at every history represented by `I`.

Retain the following distinction:

- `Observation i` is the current signal at every history;
- `InfoState i` is the acting player's complete decision-memory state;
- `infoObserve` forgets memory and returns the current signal.

`InfoState` is authoritative for strategy measurability and information
consistency.

Add reusable predicates rather than fields:

- `AllDecisionInfoRepresented`: every declared information state has a
  `DecisionInfoWitness`;
- `HasEventClockSignalPerfectRecall`: the per-transition signal sequence
  available to a player factors through its current `InfoState`;
- `HasEventClockPublicPerfectRecall`: the per-transition public-observation
  history factors through the current public state where required;
- `SignalTraceBuilder.HasPerfectRecall`: optional asynchronous trace recall
  when transitions may emit `none` as a silent event;
- `FiniteReachableInformation`: only represented decision information is
  finite.

The existing `HasPerfectRecall` remains the classical own-information and
own-action condition used by Kuhn's theorem. Signal recall is an independent
no-forgetting condition for private signals: it is neither substituted for
classic recall nor asserted to imply it. Both notions imply
no-absent-mindedness for their separate reasons. The signal proof uses the
explicit encoding law `signalHistory_length`: every legal action appends
exactly one signal coordinate. `RecallHierarchy.lean` contains payoff-free
regressions in all relevant directions: classic recall without public recall,
private-signal recall without public recall, public recall without
private-signal recall, and public recall without classic recall.

Unrepresented information states are allowed in the general carrier, but they
can make total contingent-plan types artificially large or even empty.
Textbook finite certificates should therefore require full representation, or
explicitly quotient/restrict strategies to represented information.

## 8. Strategy taxonomy

| Strategy | Intended type | Semantic role |
|---|---|---|
| Pure | one `InfoAction` at every `InfoState` | deterministic contingent plan |
| Behavioral | one local action law at every `InfoState` | fresh local randomization |
| Discrete mixed | `PMF` on pure strategies | countably supported ex-ante randomization |
| Analytic mixed | probability measure on a measurable pure-strategy space | non-discrete ex-ante randomization |
| Discrete general | `PMF` on behavioral strategies | countably supported random behavioral plan |
| Analytic general | probability measure on a measurable behavioral-strategy space | textbook general strategy in full generality |
| Quasi | a nonempty set of actions at each information state | nondeterministic permission, not probability |

The canonical discrete names are `DiscreteGeneralStrategy` and
`DiscreteGeneralProfile`; the shorter former names remain deprecated
compatibility aliases. New analytic variants live in the analytic layer and
require explicit measurable structures. Do not claim that `PMF` represents
every mixed or general strategy on an infinite or continuous strategy space.

Kuhn results are realization theorems:

- under perfect recall, a mixed plan has a behavioral realization relative to
  the stated root and opponent semantics;
- under no absent-mindedness and finite decision information, independently
  pre-sampling a behavioral table realizes repeated behavioral execution;
- neither result is a literal isomorphism of raw strategy types;
- a root-independent behavioralization of an arbitrary correlated mixed plan
  must not be asserted without stronger hypotheses.

`BoundedCompleteHistorySemantics` now makes the preserved object explicit and
classifies both the strategic mode and chance semantics. Its realization map
commutes with every source unilateral update; reverse target-deviation
coverage is a separate predicate. The infinite counterpart,
`CompletePathLawSemantics`, compares the full path measure rather than only
finite marginals. A concrete mixed-to-behavioral equality for that maximal
infinite law remains a theorem track.

## 9. Solution concepts

Utility and winning semantics share strategies but have different solution
notions.

### 9.1 Utility games

- Nash compares utility at the initial root.
- Nash on continuations uses an explicit caller-selected
  `RootPresentation`.
- standard SPE quantifies over a complete lawful subgame system.
- sequential equilibrium additionally needs beliefs, Bayes consistency, and
  sequential rationality; it is a later assessment layer, not an
  `ObservedGame` field.

### 9.2 Logical games

Two predicates are required:

- `HasPathwiseWinningStrategy W i sigma` means every complete legal play
  locally compatible with `sigma` is in `W i`, regardless of whether the
  opponent coordinates can be generated by one information-consistent
  profile;
- `HasStrategicWinningStrategy hNoChance W i sigma` quantifies over all pure
  profiles extending `sigma`.

Pathwise winning plus `HasPureProfileExtension` implies profile-based winning.
The extension witness prevents a vacuous win when another player's strategy
type is empty. The converse requires the explicit
`EveryCompatiblePlayRealizableByPureProfile` hypothesis and may fail when an
opponent information state is revisited. The `WinningSemantics` regression
proves this failure.

Keep `IsTwoPlayerDetermined W` independent from `IsTotal W`. For arbitrary
player types use the descriptive `HasSomePathwiseWinningStrategy`; do not
overload the standard determinacy name. The first theorem track is two-player,
no-chance, perfect-information play; its finite-bound step is now proved:

```text
finite decision bound -> determined                    [proved]
Acc-certified prefix well-foundedness -> determined
closed/open winning condition -> Gale-Stewart determinacy
```

Arbitrary winning sets are not determined in ordinary set theory. Finite
imperfect-information games are not determined in general. Both boundaries
require negative regression examples.

For chance games distinguish:

- robust winning: quantify over every legal nature move;
- almost-everywhere winning under an arbitrary measure:
  `AEWinningUnder`;
- almost-sure winning: require `IsProbabilityMeasure` for the fixed law and
  winning-path measure one.

These predicates are not interchangeable.

## 10. Finite textbook EFG profile

Do not add a second canonical finite semantic record. Define a reusable
certificate over `ObservedChanceGame`:

```text
FiniteEFGHypotheses G
```

with, at minimum:

- a uniform structural length bound;
- finite legal action types on represented histories;
- finite player type when a theorem enumerates profiles;
- full decision-information representation, or an explicit represented
  strategy quotient;
- decision-mover coherence at reachable histories: a history labeled with a
  player mover has a nonempty action type;
- decidable terminal and mover tests only for executable constructions.

Perfect recall, no chance, zero sum, total preferences, and decidable utility
comparison are separate theorem hypotheses.

Decision-mover coherence is not imposed on `ExtensiveGame`: execution ignores
the mover at a terminal state. It is needed by the finite contingent-plan
profile because a player-labeled terminal history otherwise induces an empty
represented `InfoAction` fiber and can make the total pure-strategy type
uninhabited. A frontend may instead normalize every terminal mover to `none`
and prove that this leaves execution unchanged.

Finite state is neither necessary nor sufficient: a finite-state arena may
cycle, while an infinite ambient state type may have a finite reachable
unfolding. Algorithms should consume the finite reachable history tree
extracted from the certificate.

Existing `GameTree`, `StochasticGameTree`, and `FiniteImperfectGame` remain
frontends. Their compilers should produce the relevant certificate when their
source assumptions justify it.

## 11. Preservation contract

Every new compiler, embedding, or extraction states exactly which of the
following it preserves:

1. complete histories or only endpoints;
2. action occurrences and information states;
3. public and private observations;
4. chance laws;
5. complete-play or terminal-outcome laws;
6. unilateral deviations;
7. perfect recall;
8. designated roots or complete lawful subgames;
9. length/well-foundedness certificates;
10. winning conditions or utility interpretations.

Use `Hom`, realization, refinement, simulation, or coupling according to the
actual strength. Reserve `Iso` for bijective data and commuting semantic
diagrams.

The maintained relation-by-relation table is
[`efg-preservation-matrix.md`](efg-preservation-matrix.md).
