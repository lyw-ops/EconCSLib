# EconCSLib

EconCSLib is a Lean 4 library and cross-linked knowledge base for
computational economics, built on
[Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).

The initial public release focuses on reusable foundations rather than complete
coverage of the field. It includes strategic, extensive, and coalitional games;
social choice and fair division; matching; auctions and mechanism design;
utility theory; and supporting mathematics such as fixed-point, minimax, and
linear-programming results.

| Surface | Link |
|---------|------|
| API reference | <https://gametheoryinlean.github.io/econcslib_doc/> |
| Knowledge blueprint | <https://gametheoryinlean.github.io/blueprint/> |

The blueprint records both formalized material and mathematical targets that
still need Lean implementations. The stable Lean import surface contains no
deferred proofs.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gametheoryinlean/EconCSLib.git
cd EconCSLib
lake exe cache get
lake build
lake build EconCSLib.Examples
```

**Lean version:** `leanprover/lean4:v4.30.0`

Import the stable library surface with:

```lean
import EconCSLib
```

Worked examples live under [`EconCSLib/Examples/`](EconCSLib/Examples).
Experimental open-problem interfaces under
[`EconCSLib/OpenProblem/`](EconCSLib/OpenProblem) are opt-in.

## Documentation

- [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md) describes architecture and contribution
  rules.
- [`docs/design/`](docs/design) contains focused API notes.
- [`docs/research/`](docs/research) retains selected mathematical design and
  proof-strategy notes.
- [`docs/maintainers/`](docs/maintainers) documents reproducible publishing
  workflows.
- [`docs/knowledge/`](docs/knowledge) is the editable source for the generated

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), then browse
the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gametheoryinlean/EconCSLib/issues) or
start a [discussion](https://github.com/gametheoryinlean/EconCSLib/discussions).

## AI Assistance

AI tools have assisted with routine proof engineering, maintenance, and
documentation. Domain contributors remain responsible for reviewing
mathematical models, theorem statements, and public API decisions.

## History

EconCSLib grew out of a game-theory formalization project at Xiamen University
Malaysia. See [`docs/HISTORY.md`](docs/HISTORY.md) for a concise project
history.

## Another Library Named EconCSLib

See also [nikhgarg/EconCSLib](https://github.com/nikhgarg/EconCSLib), a
separate project with the same name that was developed independently and
concurrently. That project focuses on AI-assisted, paper-by-paper
formalization of Economics and Computation research, together with workflows
for human review of the translation from papers into Lean. This project
focuses on the human curation, with AI assistance, of reusable definitions,
theorems, and a cross-linked knowledge base for the field. The projects are
complementary but are not affiliated.
